## Guide to Change Bash Shell Font

### Mac OS

1. **Opening Terminal Preferences**:
    - Click on the Finder icon in the dock.
    - Select "Applications" in the sidebar of Finder.
    - Find and click on "Terminal".
    - In the menu bar, select "Terminal" and then "Preferences".

2. **Modifying the Font**:
    - In the Terminal Preferences window, click on the "Text" tab.
    - Choose the desired font from the list on the left. Options may include "Monaco" or "Menlo".
    - To adjust the font size, modify the value under the "Text size" section.

3. **Conditional for Font Size Reduction**:
    - Automatically adjusting font size based on screen size isn't directly supported via Terminal settings on Mac OS.
      This kind of customization typically requires scripts or advanced command-line configurations.

### Linux

1. **Opening Terminal Settings**:
    - Depending on the desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE, XFCE), and the terminal emulator used, right-click on the
      terminal window or navigate through system settings to access terminal preferences.

2. **Modifying the Font**:
    - Within the terminal settings section, locate the "Text" or "Appearance" option.
    - Select the preferred font from the provided list.
    - Adjust the font size to suit your preferences.

3. **Conditional for Font Size Reduction**:
    - Similar to Mac OS, standard graphical settings don't offer a direct method to conditionally adjust font size based
      on screen size. This typically requires the use of scripts or advanced system configurations.
